# Module 2: EDA with SQL and EDA with Pandas & Matplotlib

This module contained **two parts**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL**  
   Learnt how to create and execute SQL queries to select, filter, and sort data effectively.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib**  
   Used Pythonâ€™s Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization to perform in-depth data exploration.

## Overview

We collected data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings using RESTful API calls and web scraping techniques. The data was then cleaned and converted into Pandas DataFrames for further wrangling and analysis.

## Objectives

- Wrote SQL queries to extract insights from data.  
- Performed data manipulation and cleaning using Pandas.  
- Created scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations using Matplotlib.  
- Extracted meaningful patterns from data to guide subsequent modeling tasks.
