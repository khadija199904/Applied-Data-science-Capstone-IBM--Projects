# Module 2: EDA with SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib & Feature Engineering

This module consisted of **two main parts**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL**  
   We wrote and executed SQL queries to explore the dataset. This allowed us to filter, sort, and aggregate relevant data related to Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

2. **EDA and Feature Engineering with Pandas and Matplotlib**  
   In this part, we used Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating visualizations.  
   After performing EDA, we conducted **feature engineering** by analyzing how key variables (like payload mass, orbit type, and launch site) impacted the success rate.  
   Based on this analysis, we selected the most relevant features that could be used for future success prediction models.  
   The final processed data was saved as `dataset_part3.csv`.

## Summary

- Collected Falcon 9 launch data using RESTful API and web scraping.  
- Converted raw data into structured Pandas DataFrames.  
- Visualized data and extracted patterns using Matplotlib.  
- Engineered useful features and prepared a clean dataset for future modeling.

## Objectives

- Write and execute SQL queries for data selection and aggregation.  
- Perform data wrangling and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
- Identify key variables that influence launch success.  
- Apply feature engineering techniques to build a refined dataset.
