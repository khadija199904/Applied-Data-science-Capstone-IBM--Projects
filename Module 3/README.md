# Module 3: Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
This module focuses on **interactive visual analytics** of SpaceX launch data and the creation of **dynamic dashboards** to explore factors affecting launch success.  

## Objectives

- Perform interactive visual analytics of SpaceX launch data using Folium.  
- Explore spatial relationships between launch sites and launch success or failure.  
- Calculate distances between launch sites and nearby landmarks or facilities.
- **Build a dashboard with Plotly Dash** to provide interactive insights on:  
  - Success vs. failure rates per launch site  
  - Payload mass distributions  
  - Orbit type statistics  
  - Geographic visualizations of launch activity  
    

## Outcome
Users can interactively explore SpaceX launch data, identify factors influencing launch success, and make data-driven insights using dashboards.
