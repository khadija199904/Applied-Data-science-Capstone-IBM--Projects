# Module 3: Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium
In this module, we perform interactive visual analytics using the Folium library. Launch success rates may depend on various factors such as:

- Payload mass  
- Orbit type  
- Location of launch sites  

By analyzing launch site locations and their proximity, we aim to identify factors that influence launch success and potentially find optimal launch site locations.

## Objectives

- Perform interactive visual analytics of SpaceX launch data using Folium.  
- Explore spatial relationships between launch sites and launch success or failure.  
- Calculate distances between launch sites and nearby landmarks or facilities.

Previous exploratory data analysis used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize correlations between launch sites and success rates. This module extends that work by adding interactive maps and spatial analysis.
