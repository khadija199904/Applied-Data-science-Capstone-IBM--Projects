# Module 4: Predictive Analysis (Classification)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can assist in making informed business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets
- Train different classification models:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Classification Trees
  - Logistic Regression
- Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search
- Evaluate models to select the best-performing one based on test data

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Load and preprocess the Falcon 9 landing data, then split it into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**  
   Train SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression models on the training data.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   Use Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for each model.

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Assess the accuracy and performance of each model on the test dataset to select the most effective one.
