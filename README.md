# Applied-Data-science-Capstone-IBM--Projects

Welcome to the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project, a hands-on course where you'll apply your data science skills to solve real-world challenges. This repository contains all the project files and resources for the capstone project, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program on Coursera.
This capstone focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data, to extract insights and build a machine learning model for predicting launch success.

## Overview
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
